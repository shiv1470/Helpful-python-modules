# Helpful-python-modules
This Repo contains some helpful modules to make my work easier.


# minCostMaxFlowBf.py

You can use this module/class implementation for various question on Max Flow. :smiley:

# ib.py
This one can make an intern life a bit easy :stuck_out_tongue:
You can use this python module to write/ read file as per the format used in input descriptor. 

Future Work: would try to make one for cpp as well.
